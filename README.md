# CrimeTweet-Analysis
A github repository for project on: Crime Evidence Gathering through Social Media: Exploratory Studies on Twitter

In this notebook, twitter data will be analyzed and a topic model will be built to determine whether data from tweets can serve law enforcement in crime evidence gathering.

Topic modeling: Topic models are used to discover and identify trends in the underlying themes in the topics being discussed on the platform. Topic modeling can help distill information into a more usable and actionable format.

Problem statement: In this project, tweets over the span of a year (October 2021 - September 2022) will be analyzed to identify the themes and topics of discussions present. Since topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique, our analysis and results are driven by how well the topic models capture the relevant topics.
